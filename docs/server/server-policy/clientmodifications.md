# Client Modifications

While most enjoy the Vanilla Minecraft experience, some of us prefer to make some changes. Below is a guide to the resourcepacks and client-side mods that have been approved by our staff team. 
This is not an exhaustive list, rather just a list of mods that we have already approved. Mods **can be used** outside of this list **in accordance with the client modifications rule.**

## Resourcepacks
Resource packs (aka texture packs) are used to change the appearance of the game.

### Prohibited Resourcepacks
- X-Ray packs (gives a player the ability to see through non-transparent blocks).
- Fullbright packs.
- Any other pack which may give a player an **unfair advantage.**

### Democracycraft Resourcepack
The Official DemocracyCraft Resourcepack (full texture overhaul with custom homescreen) /getrp or /getresourcepack in-game and select it from the GUI.

### Guns Resourcepack
Guns & Ammo Resourcepack (see custom textures for guns and ammo) ``/getrp`` or ``/getresourcepack`` in-game and select it from the GUI
